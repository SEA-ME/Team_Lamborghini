Team 'Lamborghini' made it!_
There was an continous error today. We found that, joypad and rasberry pi was connected, but no matter what happens RC car and joypad didn't response.

Savior 'Avir' helped us.

He said that, it could be the cause of not connecting with the part corresponding to each circuit diagram in the code. As a result of checking the youtube video, it was confirmed that even those who connected in the same way as ours were working normally.

Therefore, tomorrow, I decided to explore the method of modifying the code rather than solving the problem of the circuit connection method.
